Provides a programming interface to commnicate with a MakerBot or RepRap 3D printer that is using the MakerBot firmware.

Should eventually be able to do everything that ReplicatorG can do... but for now it is very incomplete.

=Examples

  require "rublicatorg"

  makerbot = RublicatorG.new("/dev/tty.usbserial-FTE3Q0I3")

  puts "Motherboard Firmware Version: #{makerbot.get_motherboard_version}"
